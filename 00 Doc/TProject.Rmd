#### Steps used to create this project
#####1. Using GitHub, create a Repo
#####2. Clone the Repository into the Data Visualization Folder (Or the folder you wish)
#####3. Create R Studio Folders for all the project development (folder descriptions below)
#####4. Find several CSVs that are related to disease and country population.
#####5. Modify the R_ETL.R given and run the code to get the code to develop a SQL table
#####6. Using Oracle SQL Developer, paste the code output from the R_ETL.R script to create a table
#####7. After the table is created, import the data from the CSV reformattted file to the table
#####8. Use a query statement similar to the TitanicAnalysis.R file (used in the last project) to build a data frame with the CSV data from Oracle 
#####9. Using Tableau we will create three different visuals and then the same visuals will be recreated with SQl and R
#####10. Generate unique plots from the workflow dataframes
#####11. Call these files in a .Rmd file using the R markdown command "source" and press Knit HTML to view the data/plots. (Code seen below) Note: Tables will also be generated to show the what the workflows created.


#### Folders Needed
#####00 Doc: Holds the .Rmd and .html files containing these instructions and project output. Also holds RPROFILE to load all required packages.
#####01 Data: Generates the code to create the table in Oracle. Gathers the data from the database for and puts it into data frames
#####02 Tableau: Contains the .tdw file and .png files for the Visualizations
#####03 R SQL Visualizations: Contains the .R files that use ggplot to generate our graphs


#### R markdown code
#####Immediately below is the code we adjusted from the R_ETL.R File. Its is directly pasted from the code because in the code it calls the csv so it cannot run if sourced.
#####The .R file is called using the command directly after. The subsequent code/graphs illustrates the code that goes into
